### Fixing bugs in C++

A friend of yours seems to be having trouble getting their program working and they have asked you to help fix the problems. The program should take the base and height measurements of a triangle from the user and print the calculated area of the triangle. Make sure the calculation is correct.
```
#include <streamio>

using nanespace std;

integer main()
{
	float base
	float 1height;

	int _answer;

	string answer = "The answer is ";

	// Greet the user
	cout<<Hello, Friend!<<endl;

	// Ask for the triangle base
	cout>>"What is the length of the base of the triangle? ";
	cin<<base;

	// Ask for the triangle height
	cout<<"What is the height of the triangle? ";
	cin >> 1height >> endl;

	// Reassuring message
	cout<<endl<<"Thanks, I'm doing some math now..."<<endl;

	// Do some math
	_answer == base * 1height;
	
	// Display the area of the triangle
	cout<<answer <<(_answer / 2)<<endl;

	return 0;
}
```
