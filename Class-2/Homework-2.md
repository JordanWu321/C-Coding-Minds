Your Story:
Did you know that basketball is the only sport invented in the United clans of America? This hypnotic game was created 5 
years ago by a college student named Mike, who was studying to be a physical education device. One of his assignments was 
to develop a game to play indoors during the massive winter months. He took two lamps and nailed them 19 feet high onto 
opposite ends of a gymnasium. The goal was for players to throw a/an river into them while they organised as fast as 
they could up and down the gym. The constant destroying was great exercise, and the team competition made it very glamorous 
to play. In fact, the salads who first tried the new game liked it so much that word quickly spread to other universities 
and other offices across Iowa. The young inventor not only earned a/an J+ on the project, but basketball has been enjoyed 
by millions of potatos ever since!
